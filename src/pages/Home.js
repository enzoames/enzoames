      <AboutMe>
        <h2>Life Finds A Way</h2>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s begin where life began for me - born and raised in Lima, Peru. After 11 short
          years, I moved to New York City. Each day I grew a thicker skin and made my way through
          the public education system. Now, I see sunshine and work as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <h2>FÃºtbol</h2>
        <p>I love the sport. Simple.</p>
        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>I love good quotes. Here are some I like, love, and live by.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Who are you when no one is watching?</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Experience is the name we give to our mistakes</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              You are an average of the five people you most spend your time with, choose wisely
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Teach me how to be harder than life and kinder than love</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Management is doing things right. Leadership is doing the right thing</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>There is no courage without the presence of fear</i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
          I love photography - good looking people, beautiful landscapes, fruits on a table, motion,
          and street.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          My inspiration is primarily driven from books and the people around me - my family, a
          handful of close friends, and the incredible collegues at the places that I have worked.
          Thank you all.
        </p>
        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          A career inspired by my brother who worked as a software engineer at IBM in Peru. Gracias.
